Thank you very much for your interest in our work!

This repository contains data and code for the AI Radar ECG. 

Below are the key components:

Demo.m: Tests the trained models using the test dataset.

TrainingPerformance.m: Displays the training performance of the trained models.

TrainedModels.m: Trains the models using the training and validation datasets.

PQRST_Detection.m: Detects P, Q, R, S, and T waves in radar ECGs.

If you utilize this code, please kindly cite the following paper:

Y.X. Wang, X.Y. Wang, and Z.H. Xu: 'Non-Contact Electrocardiogram via Millimeter-Wave Sensing and Deep Learning'."

Thank you!

Wishing you happiness every day, and may the world progress in peace.
